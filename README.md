# Uiza

## Introduction
This is documents the public API for Uiza version 3.0.

The Uiza API is organized around RESTful standard.
Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors.
JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors, although our API libraries convert responses to appropriate language-specific objects.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## Authentication
In order, to use the Uiza, you should follow these steps:

* **Step 1:** Having an active Uiza account. (If you don't have, please get [here](https://id.uiza.io/))
* **Step 2:** Once you have an Uiza account, you can get a Token to call the APIs.

This Token will have right & permission related with your account.

See details [here](https://docs.uiza.io/#callback).

## Analytic
Monitor the four key dimensions of video QoS: playback failures, startup time, rebuffering, and video quality.
These 15 metrics help you track playback performance, so your team can know exactly whatâ€™s going on.

## Embed Metadata
Embed metadata is information that can be embed into video/audio file. You can embed into file by adding a json compose these tag.

## Errors Code
Uiza uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.
In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success.
Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.).
Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Uiza's servers.
